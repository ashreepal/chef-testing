Conditionals Testing

Want to see if we can use only_if and not_if to specify when things can and
should be created. This way we can avoid trying to create directories on the
instance if they already exist.

[ Test 1 ]

Setup:
  The run list calls just recipe dir2 (which includes dir1) and
  there is an only_if '.../dir1' exists then create dir2. We run dir2 first to
  ensure that it is not created.

Results:
  Success! When dir2 called before dir1, it is not created and only dir1 is.

Note:
  Did the same with more directories, still worked fine.
  Also, seems that recipes are working in order for the most part, but I still
  don't think there's any guarantee that they will.
  Conditionals work even when you use run_action, which is perfect.
